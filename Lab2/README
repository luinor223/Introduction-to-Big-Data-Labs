## How to Run Each Script

### Task 2.1 (MapReduce - Total Revenue Calculation)
To execute Task 2.1, run the following command:
```bash
python 22127452.py <input file path> --output-dir <your desired output folder>
```
#### Example:
```bash
python 22127452.py "Amazon Sale Report.csv" --output-dir output
```

#### Handling Output Files
Since `mrjob` generates multiple output parts (e.g., `part-00000`, `part-00001`, ...), these need to be merged into a single `output.csv` file.

- **Issue:** The built-in `mrjob` function `cat_output()` for concatenating output files does not preserve the correct ordering (e.g., `part-00013` might be read before `part-00000`).
- **Solution:** The script manually reads and sorts part filename using `os.listdir()`, then merges them into a final `output.csv`.

### **Task 2.2 and 2.3**
To execute Task 2.2 and 2.3, please change the `filename` in the script to your desired input file and run the following command:
```bash
python 22127452.py
```
#### **Handling Output Files**
Since PySpark writes results in a distributed manner, multiple part files (`part-*.csv`) are generated instead of a single `output.csv`.

To merge these files into a single CSV, run:
```bash
cp /path/to/output_folder/part-*.csv output.csv
```
